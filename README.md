# Final Project : Pokemon Match Game

The Pokemon Match Game project was developed as a final project for code immersives 1st course.  The game is a Pokemon themed matching game that incorporates a few functions to interact with the player  

Poke-Match-Mon Game App: 
1.  Uses an API call to randomly fetch pokemon illustrations.
2.  Uses random logic for selecting a limited number of cards.  In this case    the amount is 10, but you can increase.
3.  Uses a set object  inplace of an array in order to remove duplicates.
4.  Uses a sort function and sort function to reshuffle both sets of pokemon.
5.  Incorporates 

	-- start and stop function that can be used to keep track of how long it takes to finish game.
	-- score increments for every positive match
	-- message feedback that player matched all cards.  In this case 10 cards.
	-- Refetch button which resets the game and zeroes out score and timer.
